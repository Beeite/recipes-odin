# recipes-odin
This will be the first (hopefully) big project following the odin project steps
i will be deviating a bit sometimes to try and test myself and try out things to learn better 

i will get a lot of info off the internet to fill in the site with interesting info
including pictures and maybe embed videos if possible

Hoping it will make me learn more about HTML and start out with css
it will be cool to learn how to integrate css to work with HTML and how linking those will look like
